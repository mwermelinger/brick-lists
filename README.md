# Brick lists

This is a repository of parts lists and images for some LEGO models I've built.
The models are taken from books and websites.
The images are my own scans.
I have no commercial affiliation with the model authors or book publishers.

The parts lists are in
[BrickLink's XML format](https://www.bricklink.com/help.asp?helpID=207).
You can upload the lists to [BrickLink](http://bricklink.com),
[BrickOwl](http://brickowl.com) or [Rebrickable](http://rebrickable.com)
to order the parts.

In BrickLink, go to the
[upload page](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/wanted/upload.page?utm_content=subnav),
click on the 'Upload BrickLink XML format' tab,
choose an existing wanted list or a new one, and
paste the content of the file into the text box.

The lists don't include the parts' condition (new/used) and maximum price,
as those criteria are up to you,
but I have assumed you don't want to be notified when new parts are for sale.

I left the colour unspecified for parts that are not visible from the outside,
but noted the original colour in the part's REMARKS field.
By explicitly noting for which parts the colour doesn't matter,
you will be able to reuse more of your own parts,
or buy cheaper used parts from a larger variety of sellers.

This repository does _not_ include the instructions to build the models.
You will have to buy or borrow the corresponding book or
follow the link to the corresponding website.
